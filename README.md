# 🛡️ Disaster Preparedness and Response Training Platform

An interactive, web-based disaster preparedness and response training platform designed to help students learn and practice emergency response procedures in a safe, scalable, and engaging environment.

The platform focuses on improving disaster awareness, preparedness, and confidence through structured learning modules, simulations, and progress tracking, without exposing users to real-world risks.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Disaster preparedness education in schools and colleges is often limited to theoretical content. Physical mock drills are difficult to conduct frequently due to safety concerns, cost, and logistical constraints.

As a result, students may panic during real emergencies and fail to follow correct response procedures. There is a need for a safe, repeatable, and accessible learning system that enables users to understand and practice disaster response effectively.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project presents a web-based disaster preparedness and response training platform that enables users to learn emergency response concepts through interactive modules and simulation-based demonstrations.

The platform allows users to:
- Understand correct disaster response steps
- Practice preparedness concepts in a controlled environment
- Track learning progress and engagement

The current implementation is developed as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to validate feasibility, usability, and system design.
