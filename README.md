🛡️ Virtual Disaster Preparedness & Training Platform

An interactive, web-based disaster preparedness learning platform designed to educate students through gamified learning and simulation-based training.
This project focuses on improving disaster awareness and response skills in a safe, engaging, and scalable way.

📌 Problem Statement

Disaster preparedness education is largely theoretical, and physical mock drills are risky, costly, and cannot be conducted frequently.
As a result, students often panic during real emergencies and fail to follow correct safety procedures.

There is a need for a safe, practical, and engaging learning system that allows students to understand and practice disaster response without real-world risks.

💡 Solution Overview

This project proposes a virtual training platform that demonstrates disaster scenarios using simulation-based learning and gamification.
The platform helps users:

Understand correct disaster response steps

Practice preparedness concepts

Stay engaged through rewards and progress tracking

The current version is developed as an MVP prototype focusing on user experience and feasibility.
